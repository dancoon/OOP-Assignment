## Assignment 2 ##

Create a structure representing a student object with the following members:
1. regno.
2. courseid
3. unitsRegistered: This should be an array of the course units you registered to capture marks
4. unitsmarks: This should be an array to store the marks for the units registered. Find a way to relate the two.
5. firstname
6. surname
7. address
By using the structure above, write a program that populates the details of a student and compute the average, and the grade as well as the total marks. This task should be accomplished by writing functions for getData() - to populate the structure, printStudent() - to display the detail of the student, computeGrade() - to compute the grade of the student and computeMean() that computes the mean of the students: Pass the appropriate data

NB: The function getData() - is a subroutine and uses structure as a reference - input, same concept to printData()

Consider that your class has 10 students. Compute the class mean and standard deviation, highest class mark and lowest class mark
